# Signal-modulaton-with-carrier-signal-in-MATLAB
The signal modulation is a basic operation in communications (eg. radio signals), but it is also useful in biomedical signal processing.
This code shows how to implement this signal modulation in MATLAB.
The repository contains two files: mgh007m.info, mgh007m.mat. These files are from the MGH/MF Waveform Database: https://archive.physionet.org/physiobank/database/mghdb/
I use a 1-minute-long Respiratory Impedance signal from mgh007m.mat file. This is an 8x21600 matrix where the 7th row is the Respiratory Impedance signal.
I use a sine carrier signal: C.*sin(2*pi*f + phi) where f = 100Hz, C = 1mV, phi = 0.
